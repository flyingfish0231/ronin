   Each data sequence is in a folder with name format "<subject_identifier>_<sequence_identifier>". A folder contains two files: 
       - "data.hdf5" - contains raw and time synchronized data from two smartphones. (See below for data description.)
       - "info.json" - contains meta information such as sensor calibration, time syncronization. (See below for meta data description.)

3. Additional related research objects that are not included in the current data package: 

Model code is shared on Github (https://github.com/Sachini/ronin). 

Due to security concerns, we are unable to publish ~ 50% of our dataset. As such, the pre-trained models published here cannot be fully reproduced using the model code in Github and the data published here (the models were trained on the larger dataset, which includes private data).

1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

Please refer to our supplementary document (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12853.pdf, pages 10-11) for the details of data collection. The Android applications developed for data collection can be found on Github (https://github.com/Sachini/ronin).


2. Methods for processing the data: 

Please refer to our supplementary document (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12853.pdf, pages 10-11) for the details of data processing steps. The source code for processing data from a single device (for inference only) can be found at https://github.com/Sachini/ronin/tree/master/source/preprocessing.


3. Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data: 
Any compatible libraries maybe use to read hdf5 and json files. We used h5py python library and the default json library for the task.
